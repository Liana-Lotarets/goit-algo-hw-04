Foxes are small-to-medium-sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. 
They have a flattened skull; upright, triangular ears; a pointed, slightly upturned snout; 
and a long, bushy tail (brush).

Twelve species belong to the monophyletic true fox group of genus Vulpes. 
Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; 
these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, 
which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.
